# Daily Log — InfraOps (GPT)

## What I did
- Hardened /api/health with DB check + build SHA
- Implemented CDK stack for alarms (5xx, p95 latency, RDS CPU)
- Added optional weekly RDS snapshot policy via AWS Backup
- Removed hardcoded DB fallbacks; Secrets Manager enforced
- Wrote unit tests for getDbUrl
- Updated OPERATIONS.md with env/ARNs/alarm names/snapshot policy

## Issues
- Amplify build logs showed prior missing secrets; enforced secret requirement now

## Solutions
- Added strict Secrets Manager requirement; documented env mapping in Amplify

## Decisions → ADRs
- Keep Amplify for SSR; alarms via CloudWatch; optional AWS Backup weekly snapshots

## TODO / Next
- Ensure repo secrets set: AWS_OIDC_ROLE_ARN, AWS_REGION, AMPLIFY_APP_ID, AMPLIFY_BRANCH
- Create Secrets Manager keys and map in Amplify
- Deploy CDK stack (`infra`) and confirm alarms in Console
- Capture screenshot of green Deploy job for PR

## Hand-offs
- Ops: provision Secrets Manager entries and confirm alarms fire on thresholds
