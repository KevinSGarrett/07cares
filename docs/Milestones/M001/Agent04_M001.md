## Agent01_M001 — QA & Docs — Prompt v3 (Milestone M001)

### Repo / Context
- Repo: `KevinSGarrett/07cares` (branch: `main`)
- Staging: `https://main.d3ru1wmw4mnh7w.amplifyapp.com`
- Local deps: Postgres `localhost:5432`, Typesense `http://localhost:8108`

### Goal
Grow tests to keep up, enforce coverage, add a11y checks, and keep docs/logs current. Ensure CI gates (typecheck, lint, unit coverage targets, e2e) are satisfied.

### What I implemented

#### 1) Unit tests (Vitest)
- Added unit tests for environment parsing and DB URL resolution:
  - `tests/unit/env.test.ts` — validates required server/client envs and defaulted values.
  - `tests/unit/getDbUrl.test.ts` — ensures precedence and fallbacks for DB URL.
- Updated coverage scope:
  - `vitest.config.cjs` — include `src/env.ts` and `src/lib/getDbUrl.ts` in coverage include list.

#### 2) Integration tests (Vitest)
- Stripe webhook route covering success and invalid signature:
  - `tests/integration/stripe-webhook.test.ts`
  - Mocks:
    - `next/headers` (header injection for `stripe-signature`)
    - `@/lib/stripe` (return deterministic `payment_intent.succeeded` or throw on invalid)
    - `@/server/db` (spy `prisma.donation.create` and `user.upsert`)
  - Stabilization details:
    - Used `vi.hoisted` for spies and `vi.doMock` for non-hoisted module mocks to avoid Vitest hoisting pitfalls.
    - Reset modules and rehydrate env per test to avoid cross-test leakage.

#### 3) E2E (Playwright)
- Config:
  - `playwright.config.ts` — enables parallel runs, launches dev server, and injects env:
    - `E2E_MOCK_STRIPE=1` to mock Stripe on the API
    - `AUTH_BYPASS=true` to keep Clerk off locally
- Smoke + a11y tests:
  - `e2e/smoke-a11y.spec.ts` — visits `/`, `/c/example-campaign`, `/portal`, runs axe checks, and asserts primary headings.
  - Uses `@axe-core/playwright` (added to devDependencies) to fail on serious/critical violations.
- Donate happy path (mocked):
  - `e2e/donate-happy.spec.ts` — uses `test.request` to call `/api/donate/create-intent` and verifies a mocked `clientSecret`.
  - API-side test hook:
    - `src/app/api/donate/create-intent/route.ts` checks `process.env.E2E_MOCK_STRIPE` and returns a deterministic `clientSecret` when set.

#### 4) Accessibility
- Integrated axe checks in E2E on Home, Campaign, and Portal pages.
- Tests fail on impact `serious` or `critical` violations.

#### 5) Docs & Logs
- Updated strategy doc:
  - `docs/QA_TEST_STRATEGY.md` — added test IDs/locations, coverage map, and E2E run instructions (including the Stripe mock flag).
- Daily log:
  - `logs/daily/2025-10-29-assistant.md` — what I did, issues, solutions, decisions, next steps, hand-offs.

### Issues encountered and solutions

- Vitest module hoisting errors when mocking route dependencies:
  - Problem: `vi.mock` factories are hoisted; top-level refs in tests caused failures.
  - Solution: Used `vi.hoisted` for spies and `vi.doMock` for late-bound mocks, ensuring mocks are registered before importing the route under test.

- Webhook signature verification returning 400:
  - Cause: `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` not mocked consistently with the test payload.
  - Fix: Mocked `constructEvent` to emit a `payment_intent.succeeded` with expected shape for the success case, and to throw for the invalid signature case.

- Secrets Manager and DB URL precedence in unit tests:
  - Challenge: Deterministically simulating AWS Secrets retrieval.
  - Fix: Used module mocking or explicit fallbacks in tests; verified env precedence and final fallback behavior.

- Playwright environment and server startup in CI-like conditions:
  - Injected `E2E_MOCK_STRIPE=1` and `AUTH_BYPASS=true` via `webServer.env` in `playwright.config.ts` to ensure deterministic behavior without real Stripe/Clerk.

### Key file locations
- Unit tests:
  - `tests/unit/env.test.ts`
  - `tests/unit/getDbUrl.test.ts`
- Integration tests:
  - `tests/integration/stripe-webhook.test.ts`
- E2E tests and config:
  - `playwright.config.ts`
  - `e2e/smoke-a11y.spec.ts`
  - `e2e/donate-happy.spec.ts`
- Source changes:
  - `src/app/api/donate/create-intent/route.ts` (adds test-mode for Stripe intent)
  - `vitest.config.cjs` (coverage includes)
- Docs/Logs:
  - `docs/QA_TEST_STRATEGY.md`
  - `logs/daily/2025-10-29-assistant.md`

### Test results (evidence)
- Unit/Integration (Vitest):
  - 22/22 tests passing locally.
  - Coverage (from V8 report):
    - Overall lines ~96.96%, functions 100% on included targets.
    - `src/env.ts`: 100% lines/branches/functions.
    - `src/lib/money.ts`: 100% lines/branches/functions.
    - `src/lib/getDbUrl.ts`: lines ~86.95% (included and above threshold for current target set).
    - `src/schemas/*`: 100%.
- E2E (Playwright):
  - Smoke + a11y tests run against `/`, `/c/example-campaign`, `/portal` with axe; tests fail on serious/critical issues.
  - Donate happy path validated via API mock (`/api/donate/create-intent`) returning deterministic `clientSecret`.
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck` passes.
- Lint: `pnpm lint` (project script) runs without errors.

### How to run locally
- Unit/Integration: `pnpm test`
- E2E: `pnpm e2e` (Playwright launches dev server with `E2E_MOCK_STRIPE=1`, `AUTH_BYPASS=true`)
- Typecheck: `pnpm typecheck`
- Lint: `pnpm lint`

### Notes and next steps
- The repository currently has no explicit Wizard/Donate UI flows. We covered Donate via a mocked API E2E until UI is available (or Stripe test UI is integrated for CI). When UI lands, add full flow E2E and include screenshots in PR descriptions per DoD.
- If the Playwright web server is flaky in CI, set `E2E_START_COMMAND="pnpm build && pnpm start"` to use a production build for stability.
- CI/Danger screenshot attachments are a PR-time step; code and tests are ready for those gates.

### Conclusion
All tasks from the initial prompt are complete:
- Unit tests added and coverage thresholds green on targeted modules.
- Integration tests for Stripe webhook stabilized and passing.
- E2E smoke + a11y in place, plus a mocked donate happy path.
- Docs updated and daily log recorded. The codebase is ready for CI with coverage and a11y gates.
